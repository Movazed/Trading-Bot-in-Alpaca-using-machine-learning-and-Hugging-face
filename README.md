# Trading Bot with Alpaca, Machine Learning, and Hugging Face

## Overview

This project is a trading bot that utilizes Alpaca's API for executing trades, integrates machine learning models from Hugging Face for data analysis, and aims to make informed trading decisions based on market trends and news sentiment.

## Features

- **Alpaca Integration:** Utilizes the Alpaca API for accessing financial market data and executing trades.

- **Machine Learning:** Implements machine learning models from Hugging Face's Transformers library for data analysis and decision-making.

- **Real-time Decision Making:** The bot processes real-time market data and news to dynamically adjust trading strategies.
